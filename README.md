# ThoughtsOnGammaRegression
As the name says, just a brain dump on the Gamma random variable and its use for regression models

# Resources to explore further

Some reources to explor further check if improving this material at some point.

* A gentle introduction to gamma regression can be found here: https://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-gamma-regression/ and the authors provide also a dataset of house prices which can be used to illustrate Gamma regression. I have saved a copy of the data hosted here http://static.lib.virginia.edu/statlab/materials/data/alb_homes.csv  in case I want to use it later and it is removed from the site.

* https://rpubs.com/jwesner/gamma_glm - Fit and interpret a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model with a Gamma likelihood in `brms()`, by Jeff Wesner. Very nice worked example

* https://seananderson.ca/2014/04/08/gamma-glms/ - A nice intro by https://seananderson.ca/. One should never forget: "There are multiple ways to parameterize the Gamma distribution, so itâ€™s important to pay attention when moving between languages and functions."

* about link functions in the Gamma, see https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/202570/link-function-in-a-gamma-distribution-glm and https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/484366/gamma-glm-why-log-link-is-more-common-than-canonical-link

* If linking to log-log weight-length regressions, e.g. see https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/77579/log-linked-gamma-glm-vs-log-linked-gaussian-glm-vs-log-transformed-lm or https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/47840/linear-model-with-log-transformed-response-vs-generalized-linear-model-with-log. Relation with log-normal GLM:
